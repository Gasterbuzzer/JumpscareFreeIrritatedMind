# Jumpscare Free Irritated Mind

A mod that removes all jumpscares from the game.
Some scenes scripted jumpscares are skipped or just removed.
This also works for the warehouse jumpscares, which instead just lead to the game over screen.
Note, none of the functionality has changed, so you can still earn achievements without any issues.
